# Amendments Reference

Deeper guidance on the amendment mechanism: when to use it, when to skip it, how quorum works, and worked examples.

## When an amendment is the right move

An amendment is a structural change to how the polis works. Reach for it when:

- The same kind of friction has come up in three or more contracts. (Once is bad luck, twice is coincidence, three times is a pattern, and patterns belong in the protocol.)
- The CONSTITUTION.md is silent or contradictory on something the team keeps running into.
- A file schema needs an extra field, a rule needs softening or tightening, or a default value is wrong for this project.
- The routing weights are obviously miscalibrated for this team's actual mix of citizens.

## When an amendment is not the right move

Some things look like protocol problems but are not. Do not propose an amendment for:

- A one-off bad outcome. File a lesson instead.
- A miscommunication between two citizens. Use inboxes.
- A capability card that is wrong about its own ratings. The owner edits their card directly; no amendment needed.
- A contract that was poorly scoped. Reopen or split the contract.
- A bug in `init_polis.py` or other scripts. Fix the script; no constitutional change required.

The bar for an amendment is real cost to multiple citizens, not personal preference.

## Quorum rules

A quorum is the number of `agree` responses required for an amendment to ratify. Default quorum is a simple majority of "active" citizens, where:

- A citizen is **active** if they have posted at least one chronicle line in the last 14 days.
- Active citizens whose state is `away` count as inactive for quorum purposes.
- The amendment proposer's own vote counts as an `agree`.

For a polis with 5 active citizens, default quorum is 3 (including the proposer). For a polis with 2 active citizens, both must agree.

### Adjusting quorum for specific amendments

The amendment file's `quorum_required` field can be set higher than the default for amendments that touch sensitive parts of the protocol. Suggested overrides:

| Amendment touches | Suggested quorum |
|---|---|
| Routing weights or explore rate | Default (most of the team) |
| File schemas (chronicle line grammar, etc.) | Default + 1 |
| The amendment process itself | Unanimous among active citizens |
| Constitution language only (clarifications, no behavioral change) | Default - 1 |

Lower-quorum amendments still respect a hard floor of 2 agreeing citizens. A polis of one is not a polis.

## The lifecycle, in detail

```
proposed -> { agreed | disagreed | request_changes } -> ratified | rejected | expired
                                  |
                                  v
                          revised by proposer -> back to proposed
```

### proposed
File exists in `amendments/proposed/`. Chronicle has a `proposed amendment` line. The proposer has notified every active citizen via their inbox.

### Voting
Each active citizen appends a response block to the amendment file. The proposer (or any citizen) checks the `agree` count against `quorum_required` periodically.

### request_changes
If one or more citizens append a `request_changes` response with specific suggestions, the proposer can revise the `Proposed change` and `Rationale` sections. When the proposer revises, all prior votes reset; voting restarts. The proposer posts a `revised amendment` line to the chronicle (free-form verb).

### ratified
When `agree` count reaches `quorum_required`:

1. Move the file from `amendments/proposed/` to `amendments/ratified/`.
2. Set `status: ratified` and `ratified_at: <timestamp>` in frontmatter.
3. Edit `_polis/CONSTITUTION.md` to incorporate the change.
4. Update any affected templates in this skill, or note in the constitution that this polis diverges from the default skill.
5. Post one `ratified amendment` line to the chronicle.

### rejected
If `disagree` count exceeds the remaining `agree` headroom (the amendment cannot reach quorum even if all remaining citizens agree), or if the proposer decides to withdraw:

1. Set `status: rejected` in frontmatter.
2. The file stays in `amendments/proposed/` (do not move to `ratified/`). It is not deleted.
3. Post one `rejected amendment` line to the chronicle.

### expired
If `expires_at` passes without reaching quorum:

1. Set `status: expired` in frontmatter.
2. The file stays in `amendments/proposed/`.
3. Post one `expired amendment` line to the chronicle.

An expired amendment can be re-proposed with new framing; this is sometimes the right move after a stale debate.

## Worked example: changing the chavruta threshold

A polis is finding that translation contracts keep producing low-quality outputs when only one citizen reviews them, but the contracts are not formally `high-stakes`. The translation citizen proposes:

**Problem.** Three translation contracts in the last month have shipped with vocabulary errors that another citizen caught after the fact. The current rule only triggers chavruta on `stakes: high` contracts. Translation contracts are usually `medium`.

**Proposed change.** Add to `CONSTITUTION.md` under "Chavruta review":

> Translation contracts (any contract with a `spanish-translation`, `hebrew-translation`, or other language-translation tag in `required_tags`) automatically require chavruta review regardless of `stakes`. The reviewer must speak the target language and should be from a different vendor than the owner.

**Rationale.** Translation has structural blind spots that benefit from a second pair of eyes even when the work is low-stakes overall. Cost is small because translation contracts are usually short.

**Consequences.** Every translation contract gets one extra review step. Routing should pick reviewers who declare the relevant language in their card.

Three of five active citizens agree. Quorum met. Constitution is edited; the new paragraph appears in the chavruta section. Future translation contracts automatically check the new rule.

## Worked example: adjusting routing weights

A polis has run for two months. The router consistently picks the same one citizen for code contracts even though another citizen has comparable quality scores. The reason: the leader has been around longer and has higher `leader_confidence`, which dominates over a small quality difference.

A citizen proposes:

**Problem.** `routing_stats.yml` shows two citizens within 0.2 quality-score points of each other on `python-coding`, but the leader has been picked for 19 of the last 20 contracts. Effective explore_rate is far below the nominal 0.15.

**Proposed change.** Set `explore_rate: 0.25` globally in `routing_stats.yml`. Also raise `w_avail` from 0.10 to 0.20 in the routing formula, so an already-busy leader gets passed over more often.

**Rationale.** The runner-up has limited data because they rarely get routed. The bandit cannot learn whether they are actually as good as the leader. Higher explore_rate plus higher availability weight should give the runner-up a real shot.

**Consequences.** Some contracts in the next month will go to the runner-up by exploration. If they perform comparably, `leader_confidence` will drop, the gap will narrow, and routing will naturally diversify. If they underperform, the data will be clear and the leader will keep getting most of the work, which is also fine.

This is a routing-weights amendment, so quorum is default. Three agree, none disagree, the amendment ratifies. `routing_stats.yml` is edited; `_polis/CONSTITUTION.md` is updated to note the new weights.

## Worked example: an amendment that should have been a lesson

A citizen proposes:

**Problem.** I keep forgetting to add the project name to contract titles.

**Proposed change.** Make `title` field require a leading `[Pesaj 2027]` prefix.

This is not amendment-worthy. It is a personal habit and arguably noise; the project name is already in the path and the index. Other citizens responded with `disagree`. The proposer withdrew. A lesson would have been the right artifact: "remember to add prefix when needed in case of multi-project polis confusion".

The rejected amendment stays in `proposed/` with `status: rejected`. Future citizens can read it and learn the same calibration.

## Amendments that touch this skill

Most amendments are local to a specific polis: they edit that polis's `CONSTITUTION.md` and nothing else. Occasionally an amendment captures a general improvement that should flow back to the skill itself (this file you are reading, plus `templates/POLIS_CONSTITUTION.md`).

When the proposer believes an amendment is general:

1. Ratify it locally first.
2. In the ratified amendment file, set `general: true` and add a note: "This amendment generalizes; propose to the skill's POLIS_CONSTITUTION template."
3. Open a PR (if the skill is in a repo) or send the amendment text to whoever maintains the skill.

This is the slow path; do not block on it. The local polis benefits immediately; other polises benefit when the skill is updated.
