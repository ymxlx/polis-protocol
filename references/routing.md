# Routing Reference

How the Polis Protocol assigns contracts to citizens, how the policy learns over time, and how to override or tune it.

## Why the polis routes at all

In a single-vendor team, "whoever is here" is fine because all citizens have similar strengths. In a cross-vendor team, the whole point is that different models have different strengths, and assigning work randomly throws that value away. Routing is what turns a heterogeneous team into a stronger team than any of its members.

The router is a recommendation engine, not an authority. It always produces a top pick, but any citizen can override (and the override is logged as data that improves future routing).

## The scoring function

When a new contract opens, the router computes a score for each registered citizen against the contract's `required_tags`. The score is a weighted combination of four signals:

```
score(citizen, contract) =
    w_history * historical_score(citizen, contract.required_tags)
  + w_self    * self_rating_score(citizen, contract.required_tags)
  + w_cost    * cost_fit_score(citizen, contract.cost_ceiling)
  + w_avail   * availability_score(citizen)
```

Default weights:

```
w_history = 0.55
w_self    = 0.20
w_cost    = 0.15
w_avail   = 0.10
```

The history weight dominates once data exists. Self-rating dominates for cold-start. Cost and availability are tiebreakers.

### historical_score

For each tag in `required_tags`, look up the citizen's stats in `routing_stats.yml`. If the citizen has stats:

```
tag_history_score = (avg_quality_score / 5.0) * confidence_factor(contracts_completed)
```

Where `confidence_factor` rises with sample size:

```
confidence_factor(n) = 1 - 1 / (1 + n / 3)
# n=0 → 0 (no confidence)
# n=3 → 0.5
# n=10 → ~0.77
# n=30 → ~0.91
```

Aggregate across all required tags: simple mean if the contract requires all tags equally, or weighted mean if the contract opener specified tag weights.

If the citizen has no history on a tag, that tag contributes 0 to historical_score (which is why self-rating matters in cold-start).

### self_rating_score

For each tag in `required_tags`, look up the citizen's self-rating in their capability card. If the tag is missing, score 0 for that tag.

```
tag_self_score = self_rating / 5.0
```

Aggregate the same way as historical_score.

### cost_fit_score

A simple alignment between the contract's `cost_ceiling` and the citizen's `cost_envelope.relative`:

```
contract \ citizen | low | medium | high
low                | 1.0 | 0.5    | 0.0
medium             | 1.0 | 1.0    | 0.5
high               | 1.0 | 1.0    | 1.0
```

A high-budget contract is happy with anyone. A low-budget contract penalizes expensive citizens. This is intentional; the team's overall cost is a real constraint.

### availability_score

```
1.0  if state is "idle"
0.7  if state is "working" and current_contract is not blocked
0.3  if state is "blocked" or "reviewing"
0.0  if state is "away" or last_active > 14 days ago
```

This keeps the router from piling work on a citizen who is already buried.

## Exploration: the bandit part

After scoring everyone, the router does one of two things:

- With probability `(1 - explore_rate)`, **exploit**: pick the top-scored citizen.
- With probability `explore_rate`, **explore**: pick a different citizen, weighted by score (the top citizen is excluded; everyone else is weighted by their score).

Default `explore_rate` is 0.15. This is the exploration percentage from `routing_stats.yml`. It can be tuned globally or per-tag.

### Why explore at all

The leader on a tag is the leader based on past data. If the leader is genuinely much better than everyone else, exploring once in a while costs a small amount of quality. If the leader is *not* actually much better, or if a new citizen has joined and not yet had a chance to prove itself, exploring is how the router finds out. Without exploration, the policy ossifies and the team's specialization gets locked in even when the world has changed.

### Adaptive exploration

A more sophisticated policy adjusts `explore_rate` per tag based on `leader_confidence`:

```
adaptive_rate = base_rate + (1 - leader_confidence) * adjustment_factor
```

So tags where the leader has 30 completed contracts get a low explore rate (close to base), and tags where the leader has only 2 completed contracts get a higher explore rate (more exploration until the data firms up).

The `init_polis.py` script writes the simple fixed-rate policy by default. Switch to adaptive via `scripts/route_contract.py --adaptive`.

## Updating the policy when a contract settles

When a contract moves to `_polis/contracts/settled/`, the router updates `routing_stats.yml`:

1. For each tag in `required_tags`, find the entry for the owner.
2. Increment `contracts_completed` by 1.
3. Update `avg_quality_score` (running mean) using the `Settlement.Quality self-score` from the contract.
4. Update `avg_actual_minutes` (running mean) using the actual time spent.
5. Update `last_completed` to today's date.
6. Recompute `leader` and `leader_confidence` for the tag.

`leader_confidence` is the gap between the leader and the runner-up, scaled by total sample size:

```
gap = leader.avg_quality_score - runner_up.avg_quality_score
total_n = sum of contracts_completed across all citizens for this tag
leader_confidence = sigmoid(gap * sqrt(total_n) / 3)
# A confident leader has a large gap with lots of data behind it.
```

The full implementation is in `scripts/route_contract.py`. If you are running the protocol without scripts, a citizen can update `routing_stats.yml` by hand following the same rules.

## Overriding the router

Any citizen can claim a contract the router did not recommend them for. To override:

1. Edit the contract's frontmatter:
   - Set `owner:` to your agent ID.
   - Set `routing.override:` to a short string explaining why.
2. Post `overrode routing` to the chronicle.
3. Proceed with the contract normally.

Common legitimate override reasons:

- "Recommended citizen is offline and the deadline is tight."
- "I have specific context on this project that does not show up in routing_stats yet."
- "Trying to build up my history on this tag deliberately."

The override is itself data. If the override produces a high-quality settlement, that flows into the citizen's stats and may make them the leader next time. If it produces a low-quality settlement, the citizen's stats reflect that too. Either way, the policy learns.

## Cold-start: when a polis has no history

A brand-new polis has empty `routing_stats.yml`. The first dozen contracts route based almost entirely on self-ratings, which is fine but error-prone (citizens are bad judges of themselves).

A few practices help:

- **Open small, low-stakes contracts first.** Get a few settlements in before opening anything high-stakes.
- **Use higher explore_rate for the first 20 contracts.** Bump to 0.30 to spread early work across citizens. Drop back to 0.15 once each citizen has 3+ completed contracts.
- **Treat the first month as data collection.** The point is to learn who is actually good at what; the routing decisions are not the deliverable yet.

## Tuning for your project

The defaults assume a medium-trust, medium-data, medium-stakes project. Real polises vary.

| Project shape | Suggested tuning |
|---|---|
| Tight deadline, expensive errors | Lower explore_rate (0.05). Stick to known leaders. |
| Long-running with time to learn | Higher explore_rate (0.25). Discover better specialization. |
| Few citizens, similar strengths | Lower w_history, higher w_avail. Routing is basically load-balancing. |
| Many citizens, sharp specialization | Higher w_history. Lean on the policy. |
| High cost sensitivity | Higher w_cost (0.30+). Prefer cheaper citizens when quality is close. |

All tunings should be ratified as amendments rather than edited unilaterally. The router's behavior is part of the protocol.

## Diagnosing routing pathologies

Symptoms and likely causes:

- **The same citizen keeps getting everything.** Either they are genuinely much better (fine), or `explore_rate` is too low, or other citizens have low `availability_score` because they are always marked `working`. Check `status.md` files for stale `state` fields.
- **The router picks a citizen who consistently underperforms.** Their `self_rating` is probably miscalibrated. The owner should lower it on their next session. Lessons should also be filed so the next contract has the warning in context.
- **A new citizen never gets routed work.** Cold-start with no history. Their `self_rating` may be honest-but-low. Use the override mechanism for a few contracts deliberately, or raise their `self_rating` if it is wrong.
- **`routing_stats.yml` drifts from reality.** The policy has not been updated on recent settlements. Run `scripts/route_contract.py --reconcile` to rebuild stats from the settled contracts. Or, do it by hand by replaying the settlements in order.
