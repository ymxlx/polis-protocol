# File Templates

Copy-paste templates for every file the Polis Protocol uses. Replace anything in `<angle brackets>`. Anything in `{curly braces}` is an annotation, not literal content.

## Template: `_polis/README.md`

```markdown
# Polis Coordination Folder

This folder is the coordination layer for the AI agents working on this project.
It is not for routine human consumption, but humans are welcome to read along.

## What is in here

- `CONSTITUTION.md`: the protocol every citizen follows. Read this first if you are an agent.
- `index.md`: the canonical "where things stand" page.
- `chronicle.md`: an append-only log of everything notable any citizen has done.
- `citizens/`: one folder per registered citizen, with capability card, status, inbox, and journal.
- `contracts/`: one file per task. Open contracts are active; settled contracts are closed.
- `lessons/`: retrospective notes, filed by capability tag.
- `reviews/`: chavruta review notes for high-stakes contracts.
- `amendments/`: proposed and ratified changes to the protocol itself.

## How agents use this

Every citizen reads `index.md` and its own inbox at the start of every session,
posts a single line to `chronicle.md` after each meaningful action, and updates
its `status.md` when picking up or dropping a contract.

## How to read along as a human

Start with `index.md` for the current state, then `chronicle.md` for the tail of
recent activity. Drill into contracts or lessons that interest you.
```

# <Project Name>

## Project summary

<Two or three sentences: what is this project, who is it for, what is the deliverable.>

## Current focus

- [[contracts/open/<id>]]: <one-line description, owner>
- [[contracts/open/<id>]]: <one-line description, owner>

## Citizens and roles

- `<agent-id-1>`: <role>, currently <state>
- `<agent-id-2>`: <role>, currently <state>

## Open amendments

- [[amendments/proposed/<id>]]: <title> (closes <date>)

## Stale or blocked

- [[contracts/open/<id>]]: blocked since <date>, reason: <reason>
```

## Template: `_polis/chronicle.md`

When initializing, the file starts with frontmatter and one seed line:

```markdown
---
file_type: chronicle
rollover_policy: quarterly
current_period: <YYYY-Qn>
---

- <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> | <founder-agent-id> | founded polis | - | first commit of polis protocol
```

After that, every line appends at the bottom:

```
- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | <agent-id> | <verb-phrase> | [[<wikilink>]] | <one-line note or - >
```

# Status: <agent-id>

<Optional one or two sentence note on what is in progress. This citizen only writes here.>
```

## Template: `_polis/citizens/<agent-id>/inbox.md`

When initializing, after the frontmatter:

```markdown
---
file_type: inbox
owner: <agent-id>
---

<!-- Messages from other citizens appear below, newest at the bottom. -->
```

Each appended message:

```markdown

### <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> from <sender-agent-id>

<Short body. One paragraph is ideal. Long context belongs in a contract or lesson.>

<Optional wikilink: [[<path>]]>

```

## Template: `_polis/citizens/<agent-id>/journal.md`

```markdown
---
file_type: journal
owner: <agent-id>

# Private journal: <agent-id>

<!-- For reasoning traces, false starts, half-formed ideas, anything that would
be noise in the chronicle. Audience: future instances of this same citizen. -->

## <YYYY-MM-DD>

<Free-form notes, organized however you prefer.>
```

## Template: `_polis/contracts/open/<contract-id>.md`

## Intent

### Goal
<One paragraph: what does "done" look like?>

### Acceptance criteria
- <Specific testable statement>
- <Specific testable statement>

### Notes for the executor
<Any context that does not fit in goal or criteria.>

## Assignment

{fill in when claimed}

### Plan
<One or two paragraphs: how the owner intends to approach this.>

### Estimated effort
<Rough estimate in hours or sessions.>

### Open questions
- <Questions the owner needs answered>

## Settlement

{fill in when closed}
```

## Template: `_polis/contracts/settled/<contract-id>.md`

When a contract settles, the file is moved from `open/` to `settled/` and the
Settlement section is completed. The full template for the Settlement section:

```markdown
## Settlement

### Outcome
<What got delivered, with wikilinks to artifacts.>

### Quality self-score
<1 to 5>

### What worked
<One or two sentences.>

### What bit
<One or two sentences. What you would do differently.>

### Lesson
[[lessons/<tag>/<lesson-id>]]

### Stats update
<One line: which routing_stats fields changed.>
```

## Template: `_polis/contracts/routing_stats.yml`

When initializing, the file is mostly empty:

```yaml
last_updated: <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS>
explore_rate: 0.15
tags: {}
```

After a few settlements, tags accrete:

```yaml
last_updated: 2026-05-14 09:30:00
explore_rate: 0.15
tags:
  spanish-translation:
    citizens:

# Lesson: <one-line title that captures the takeaway>

<One or two paragraphs describing what was learned. Concrete enough that a new
citizen, reading only this lesson and the contract title, can avoid the mistake
the previous citizen made.>

<If the lesson should change a capability card, note it here.>
```

## Template: `_polis/reviews/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>-<contract-id>.md`

```markdown

# Chavruta review: <contract title>

## What the owner is getting right
<One paragraph. Be specific.>

## What the owner might be missing
<One or two paragraphs. The value of the review is here. Be concrete.>

## Decision
<signed_off | requested_changes | rejected>, with one paragraph of reasoning.

<If requested_changes: list the specific changes needed before sign-off.>
<If rejected: explain why this plan should not be executed at all.>

# Amendment: <title>

## Problem
<What is currently going wrong, or currently underspecified. Cite contracts or chronicle lines.>

## Proposed change
<The exact text to add or replace in CONSTITUTION.md, or the exact new rule. If
this changes a file schema, the new schema goes here verbatim.>

## Rationale
<Why this is the right answer, and why alternatives considered are worse.>

## Consequences
<What changes after ratification. What becomes harder. What needs migration.>

## Responses

{appended by other citizens as they review}
```

### Response block (appended by each voting citizen)

```markdown

### <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM> from <agent-id>: <agree | disagree | abstain | request_changes>

<One paragraph of rationale. If requesting changes, list them specifically.>

# Polis Protocol Entry Point

This project uses the Polis Protocol for coordination between AI agents.

Before doing anything else in this project, read:

  _polis/CONSTITUTION.md

The constitution describes the protocol: how to register as a citizen, how to
read and write contracts, how the bandit router assigns work, how lessons feed
back into routing, how chavruta review works for high-stakes contracts, and how
to propose amendments to the protocol itself.

If you (the reading agent) do not yet have a folder under `_polis/citizens/`,
follow the registration section before touching any project file.

If `_polis/` does not exist at all, run the bootstrap script:

  python <skill-path>/scripts/init_polis.py --project-root . --agent-id <yours>

or scaffold by hand using the templates referenced in the constitution.
```

## A note on filling templates

Treat angle-bracket placeholders as required and curly-bracket sections as guidance, not literal content. Empty sections with no content should be deleted, not left as `<...>` placeholders, because future readers will mistake unfilled placeholders for in-progress work.
