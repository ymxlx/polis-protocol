# Troubleshooting Reference

Failure modes, recovery procedures, scaling guidance, and the migration path from agent-vault.

## Stalled contracts

### A contract has had no activity for days

Symptoms: `status: in_progress`, `owner` is set, but no chronicle lines mention it and the work log inside the contract has not grown.

Diagnosis. Look at the owner's `status.md`. If `last_active` is recent and `current_contract` points elsewhere, the owner moved on without closing the contract. If `last_active` is also stale, the owner has gone silent.

Recovery.

1. Post a one-line note in the owner's inbox: "Is `contracts/open/<id>` still active? It has not moved in <n> days."
2. If no response within the project's stale threshold (default 14 days), any citizen can transfer ownership. Edit the contract's `owner:` field, set `routing.override: "previous owner went silent"`, post `claimed contract` to the chronicle.
3. Read the existing Plan section before continuing. Decide whether to keep the plan, revise it, or restart.

### A contract is genuinely blocked on external input

The owner cannot proceed without something only the user (or someone outside the polis) can provide.

1. Set `status: blocked` in the contract's frontmatter.
2. Update `status.md` with `state: blocked` and add the contract to `blockers:`.
3. Post `blocked on <thing>` to the chronicle, with a one-line note about what the blocker is.
4. When unblocked, post `unblocked` to the chronicle and return the contract to `in_progress`.

Other citizens reading the chronicle should not pick up a blocked contract; the block usually has context that does not transfer.

## Routing problems

### The same citizen keeps getting picked

If this is genuinely the right citizen, nothing is wrong. To check whether it is genuinely the right one, look at:

- Their `avg_quality_score` vs. the runner-up. If the gap is small but `leader_confidence` is high because of sample size, the policy is locked in. Propose an amendment raising the explore_rate.
- Their `availability_score`. If they are always `idle` because they never update their state, raise `w_avail` so the router considers load.
- Whether other citizens' `self_rating` on the relevant tag is too low. Citizens often under-rate themselves on tags where they are actually fine.

### A clearly-capable citizen never gets routed

Cold-start problem. The bandit has no history to lean on, the citizen's `self_rating` may be conservative, and exploration is too rare to break the cycle.

Two practical fixes:

1. **Manual override**. Claim three or four contracts deliberately with `routing.override: "seeding history on this tag"`. After settlement, history fills in and the bandit will start routing them naturally.
2. **Raise self-rating temporarily**. If the citizen knows they are good at a tag, bumping their `self_rating` to 5 will affect early routing until history takes over.

Neither requires an amendment. These are routine policy actions.

### `routing_stats.yml` looks wrong

If the stats file shows numbers that do not match what actually happened (a citizen with no settled contracts has stats, or a citizen with many settled contracts has empty stats), the policy got out of sync with the contracts.

Recovery. Reconcile from the settled contracts directory:

```
python scripts/route_contract.py --reconcile
```

This rebuilds `routing_stats.yml` from scratch by replaying every settlement in `_polis/contracts/settled/` in chronological order. Idempotent and safe to re-run.

Without scripts: manually rebuild. List all settled contracts, sort by `settled_at`, and for each one update the relevant stats entries.

## Citizens drifting

### A citizen has gone silent

Check `status.md` (last_active) and the chronicle (last line bearing their agent ID).

If silent for more than 14 days:

1. Try a chronicle ping: post a line with `nudged inactive citizen` and a wikilink to their profile. If they read the chronicle on next entry, they will see the ping.
2. If silent for 30 days, treat as inactive. Their open contracts can be transferred. Their capability card stays in place (the polis may want them back). Do not delete.

### A citizen's outputs have gotten worse

If `avg_quality_score` for a citizen is trending down on a specific tag, there is usually a reason. Look at recent lessons filed against contracts that citizen owned. If a pattern emerges (the citizen keeps missing the same kind of thing), three things help:

- File a clear lesson, tagged with the relevant capability tag, so future routing decisions are warned.
- The citizen should lower their `self_rating` for that tag.
- Consider an amendment requiring chavruta review for that tag if the failure pattern is severe.

### A citizen disagrees with their own stats

A citizen sees their `avg_quality_score` on a tag is lower than they believe is fair. Maybe the scoring was harsh, or a low-quality contract should not have been counted.

The system trusts the recorded scores. If the citizen believes the scoring was wrong, the right move is to file a lesson about the scoring issue, not to edit `routing_stats.yml` directly. Editing stats unilaterally is a trust break in the protocol; it should always go through an amendment if the policy needs adjusting.

## Sync and concurrency

### Two citizens claimed the same contract at the same time

The contract's `owner:` field went from `null` to two different values in close succession. Whichever write committed last wins on the filesystem, but the losing citizen may have already started work.

Recovery.

1. The losing citizen posts a chronicle line: `released contract | [[contracts/open/<id>]] | claimed by <winner> moments earlier`.
2. The losing citizen posts to the winner's inbox if they did any meaningful prep work, so the winner can use it.
3. The losing citizen picks another contract.

This is rare but real. The protocol does not prevent it; the chronicle makes it recoverable.

### A sync conflict in the chronicle

Tools like Obsidian Sync, Dropbox, and git can produce a conflict file when two citizens append to `chronicle.md` simultaneously. The file might be renamed to something like `chronicle (conflict 2026-05-14).md`.

Recovery. Both files are append-only, so the union of lines is the correct content. Steps:

1. Open both files.
2. Combine all chronicle lines.
3. Sort by timestamp.
4. Write back to `chronicle.md`.
5. Delete the conflict copy.

This is safe because chronicle lines are independent; ordering by timestamp is the canonical ordering.

For files that are not append-only (contracts, the index, capability cards), conflicts require manual merge. Post a chronicle line: `resolved conflict | [[<path>]] | merged by hand`.

### A capability card was edited by someone other than the owner

The card's `content_hash` will mismatch (`polis verify` flags it). Other citizens noticing the mismatch should:

1. Check the chronicle to see who last wrote to the card.
2. If the writer is not the owner, restore the previous version (from git, Obsidian's file history, or by asking the owner).
3. Post a chronicle line: `restored card | [[citizens/<id>/capability_card]] | content_hash mismatch resolved`.

This is an integrity check, not a security mechanism. The protocol assumes citizens are not adversarial.

## Quorum problems

### An amendment cannot reach quorum

After two weeks, the amendment has some `agree` votes but not enough. Causes:

- Some active citizens have not seen it. Check their `last_seen_amendment` field; if it is older than the amendment, ping them via inbox.
- The amendment is genuinely controversial. Read the `request_changes` and `disagree` responses; revise and re-circulate.
- The active-citizen count has dropped. Quorum is computed against the current active set; if half the polis went silent, quorum is now lower.

If after 30 days the amendment expires without quorum, that is a real signal that the change is not wanted. Re-proposing without addressing the dissent will just expire again.

### Quorum was reached but nobody ratified

The amendment file has enough `agree` votes but `status` is still `proposed` and `ratified/` is empty. This happens when everyone assumes someone else will do it.

Any citizen can move the file. Whoever notices first should:

1. Move `amendments/proposed/<id>.md` to `amendments/ratified/<id>.md`.
2. Edit frontmatter: `status: ratified`, `ratified_at: <now>`.
3. Apply the change to `_polis/CONSTITUTION.md`.
4. Post `ratified amendment` to the chronicle.

## Scaling

### The chronicle has grown beyond a comfortable read

Default rollover is quarterly. When the current quarter ends, move `chronicle.md` to `chronicle-YYYY-Qn.md` and start a fresh `chronicle.md` with frontmatter and a `rolled over chronicle` line.

The fresh file does not duplicate the old content. Citizens reading the chronicle on session entry only read the current period plus their `last_seen_event` position; they do not need to read archives.

If the project is high-traffic (more than 100 chronicle lines per week), consider daily files (`chronicle/2026-05-14.md`) and have citizens read only files newer than `last_seen_event`.

### Settled contracts pile up

After 90 days, settled contracts can move to `_polis/contracts/archive/<YYYY>/`. Citizens rarely read old settled contracts; the lessons distill the important parts.

Do not archive contracts that are still linked from open contracts or recent lessons.

### Lessons pile up

Lessons never archive. They are the polis's memory. If a lessons folder for a single tag has more than 50 entries, consider distilling: write a "summary of lessons" file at `_polis/lessons/<tag>/_summary.md` that captures the recurring themes. Individual lesson files stay in place for citation purposes.

### Too many citizens

A polis with more than 15 active citizens starts to have meetings-are-meetings problems. The chronicle gets noisy, quorum gets unwieldy, and routing has too many candidates.

Practical responses:

- Split the polis. A large project usually decomposes into sub-projects; give each its own polis with overlapping citizen membership.
- Tighten chronicle granularity. Most actions in a large polis should not produce chronicle lines.
- Use sub-quorums for amendments. Amendments touching only one sub-project's tags require quorum only among citizens active on those tags.

## Migrating from agent-vault

If a project is already using the agent-vault skill and wants to move to Polis Protocol, the migration is mostly mechanical because both skills are markdown-everywhere and share a portability philosophy.

### Mapping

| agent-vault | polis-protocol |
|---|---|
| `_multi-agent/AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` | `_polis/CONSTITUTION.md` |
| `_multi-agent/index.md` | `_polis/index.md` |
| `_multi-agent/events.md` | `_polis/chronicle.md` |
| `_multi-agent/agents/<id>/profile.md` | `_polis/citizens/<id>/capability_card.yml` (transform; richer) |
| `_multi-agent/agents/<id>/status.md` | `_polis/citizens/<id>/status.md` (extend with `last_seen_amendment`) |
| `_multi-agent/agents/<id>/inbox.md` | `_polis/citizens/<id>/inbox.md` (verbatim) |
| `_multi-agent/agents/<id>/log.md` | `_polis/citizens/<id>/journal.md` (verbatim, rename) |
| `_multi-agent/tasks/<slug>.md` | `_polis/contracts/open/<slug>.md` (transform; richer schema) |
| `_multi-agent/decisions/<id>.md` | `_polis/amendments/ratified/<id>.md` (if the decision is protocol-shaped) or stays as a per-project artifact (if it is a project decision, not a protocol one) |
| `_multi-agent/handoffs/<id>.md` | Mostly absorbed into the contract's `Assignment` section; explicit handoff notes can live in `_polis/handoffs/` if the team prefers (this is a local extension, document in the constitution) |

### Steps

1. Run `scripts/init_polis.py --project-root <vault-root> --agent-id <yours>` to scaffold `_polis/`.
2. For each agent in `_multi-agent/agents/`, transform their `profile.md` into a `capability_card.yml`. This is mostly hand work; the profile prose maps to the `evidence` field on each capability tag. Self-ratings come from the profile's "Strengths" and "Limitations" sections.
3. Copy `events.md` into `chronicle.md`. The line format is identical.
4. For each existing task, transform into a contract. The schemas overlap; the new fields (`stakes`, `required_tags`, `cost_ceiling`, `routing`, `review`) need to be filled in. For old tasks, set `stakes: low` and infer tags from the task content.
5. Build `routing_stats.yml` from scratch as new contracts settle, or pre-seed it with self-rated values if the team has many existing tasks to leverage.
6. Edit the bridge pointers (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`) at the project root to point to the new constitution.
7. Post one chronicle line: `migrated from agent-vault | [[_polis/CONSTITUTION]] | full schema upgrade`.

Old `_multi-agent/` can stay in place as an archive or be removed once everyone has caught up to the new structure.

### Living with both

If a project must support agents that read agent-vault and agents that read polis-protocol simultaneously (mid-migration), keep both folders for a transition window. The bridge pointers can list both paths; agents pick the structure they recognize. This is awkward; minimize the transition window.
