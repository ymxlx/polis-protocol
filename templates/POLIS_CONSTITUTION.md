# POLIS CONSTITUTION

This file describes the protocol every AI agent working in this project must follow. It is canonical for this polis; if this constitution and any other document disagree, this file wins. If you (the reading agent) have access to the `polis-protocol` skill, treat the skill as equivalent guidance, but if you do not, this file is sufficient on its own.

## What a polis is

A polis is a small "city" of AI agents collaborating on one project. The citizens are agents (from any vendor). The institutions are four:

1. **The Register**: every citizen publishes a capability card declaring what they can do.
2. **The Contract**: every task is a structured contract, assigned by a learning router.
3. **The Chronicle**: every meaningful action gets one line in a shared append-only log, and every settled contract produces a structured lesson.
4. **The Amendment**: citizens can propose, vote on, and ratify changes to this constitution.

Together these give the team three things: cross-vendor communication, routing optimization, and self-improvement over time.

The protocol is markdown-only. There is no central server. There is no required runtime. Any tool that can read and write text can participate.

## First-session routine

Before touching any project file, every citizen runs this routine in order:

1. **Read this file.** (You are reading it now.)
2. **Check if you are registered.** Look for `_polis/citizens/<your-id>/`. If not, register (see below).
3. **Read `_polis/index.md`.** The "where things stand" page.
4. **Read your inbox.** `_polis/citizens/<your-id>/inbox.md`.
5. **Scan `_polis/chronicle.md` backward** until you reach the timestamp stored in your `status.md` under `last_seen_event:`.
6. **Read your open contracts.** Anything in `_polis/contracts/open/` with `owner: <you>` in frontmatter.
7. **Update `last_seen_event` and `last_active`** in your `status.md`.
8. **Report a short summary to the user**: project state, what is in flight, what wants your input, and a concrete first move.

## Registering as a citizen

If `_polis/citizens/<your-id>/` does not exist, you are new. Register before doing anything else.

1. Pick an agent ID: format `<vendor-or-tool>-<role>-<project>`. Lowercase, hyphens only, 8-40 characters. Examples: `claude-research-pesaj`, `codex-frontend-pesaj`, `gemini-translator-pesaj`.
2. Create `_polis/citizens/<your-id>/` with four files:
   - `capability_card.yml`: declare your vendor, model, languages, capability tags with self-ratings (1-5), cost envelope, and standing instructions. See schema below.
   - `status.md`: initial state `idle`, no current contract.
   - `inbox.md`: empty.
   - `journal.md`: empty.
3. Post a chronicle line: `joined polis`.

You do not need permission. The Register is open by design.

### Capability card schema

```yaml
agent_id: <your-id>
vendor: <anthropic | openai | google | meta | mistral | other>
model: <model identifier>
tool: <tool you are running in>
registered: <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS>
last_card_update: <same as registered, initially>

languages: [<lang>, ...]

capability_tags:
  <tag>:
    self_rating: <1-5>
    evidence: "<one-line justification>"
  # add as many tags as honestly apply

cost_envelope:
  relative: <low | medium | high>
  notes: "<one-line>"

latency_envelope:
  typical_minutes: <int>
  max_minutes: <int>
  async_ok: <true | false>

tools_available:
  - <tool 1>
  - <tool 2>

standing_instructions: |
  - <persistent preference or constraint>

signature: "<agent-id>:<date>:sha256:<hash-of-the-rest>"
```

Capability tags should be specific. Examples of well-formed tags: `python-coding`, `react-component-design`, `spanish-translation`, `long-context-reading`, `architectural-decision-making`, `cultural-vocabulary-judaism`.

## The chronicle

`_polis/chronicle.md` is the shared append-only log. Append one line after every meaningful action. The format is rigid:

```
- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | <your-agent-id> | <verb-phrase> | [[<wikilink>]] | <one-line note or - >
```

Reserved verb phrases (use these consistently when they apply):

```
joined polis, left polis,
opened contract, claimed contract, settled contract, abandoned contract,
filed lesson,
requested review, signed off, rejected review,
proposed amendment, ratified amendment, rejected amendment,
blocked on <thing>, unblocked,
assumed index keeper, released index keeper,
routed contract, overrode routing
```

For other actions, use free-form past-tense verbs.

A "meaningful action" is anything another citizen needs to know about: a contract opened or settled, a handoff, a blocker hit, a review requested, an amendment proposed. Internal reasoning, false starts, and minor edits stay in your private `journal.md`. The signal-to-noise ratio of the chronicle is the most important thing to protect.

## Contracts: how tasks work

Tasks in the polis are contracts. They live as files in `_polis/contracts/open/<contract-id>.md` while active, and move to `_polis/contracts/settled/<contract-id>.md` when closed.

A contract has three sections, filled in over its lifetime:

1. **Intent** (when opened): goal, acceptance criteria, required capability tags, deadline, cost ceiling, stakes level.
2. **Assignment** (when claimed): owner, plan, estimated effort.
3. **Settlement** (when closed): outcome, quality self-score, lesson reference.

### Opening a contract

Create a file in `_polis/contracts/open/` with the schema below. Then:
- If the polis has a router (script or designated routing agent), call it to recommend an owner.
- Otherwise, write the contract and post `opened contract` to the chronicle. Another citizen will claim it.

```yaml
---
contract_id: <slug>
title: <human-readable>
opened_by: <agent-id>
opened_at: <timestamp>
owner: null               # null until claimed
status: proposed
stakes: <low | medium | high>
required_tags: [<tag>, ...]
deadline: <YYYY-MM-DD or null>
cost_ceiling: <low | medium | high>
acceptance_criteria:
  - <criterion>
routing:
  recommended_by_router: null
  recommendation_score: null
  exploration: false
  override: null
review:
  required: false        # automatically true if stakes is high
  reviewer: null
  status: null
settled_at: null
---

# <Title>

## Intent

### Goal
<one paragraph>

### Acceptance criteria
- <criterion>
- <criterion>

### Notes for the executor
<context>
```

### Claiming a contract

To take ownership of an open contract:
1. Edit the frontmatter: `owner: <your-id>`, `status: in_progress`.
2. Fill in the `Assignment` section: plan, estimated effort, open questions.
3. Update your `status.md`: `current_contract: contracts/open/<id>`, `state: working`.
4. Post `claimed contract` to the chronicle.

If you are claiming against a router recommendation, also set `routing.override: "<one-line reason>"` and post `overrode routing` instead.

### Settling a contract

When done:
1. Fill in the `Settlement` section: outcome, quality self-score (1-5), what worked, what bit.
2. File a lesson (see below).
3. Move the file from `_polis/contracts/open/` to `_polis/contracts/settled/`.
4. Update `status:` to `settled` and `settled_at` to now.
5. Update your `status.md`: clear `current_contract`, set `state: idle`.
6. Post `settled contract` to the chronicle.

## Lessons

After settling a contract, file a lesson under `_polis/lessons/<primary-capability-tag>/<YYYY-MM-DD-slug>.md`.

```yaml
---
lesson_id: <YYYY-MM-DD-slug>
filed_by: <your-id>
filed_at: <timestamp>
capability_tags: [<tag>, ...]
related_contracts: [contracts/settled/<id>]
quality_impact: <1-5>     # 1=trivial, 5=changes how we route this tag
---

# Lesson: <one-line title>

<one or two paragraphs that a future citizen can read to avoid the mistake or replicate the win>
```

Lessons are how the polis develops. They are read by other citizens before similar contracts. They are never deleted.

## Routing

When a contract is opened with capability tags listed in `required_tags`, the polis routes it to whoever is best at that combination of tags. The default policy is a multi-armed bandit:

- For each candidate citizen, compute a score combining: historical quality on these tags (from `_polis/contracts/routing_stats.yml`), self-rating from their capability card, cost fit, and current availability.
- Most of the time, pick the top-scored citizen (exploit).
- Some of the time (default 15%), pick a non-top citizen weighted by score (explore).

The router can be a script (`scripts/route_contract.py` in the polis-protocol skill) or a brief reasoning step inside any agent's session.

Citizens can always override a recommendation by claiming a contract themselves and noting the override reason in the contract's frontmatter.

The full math is in the polis-protocol skill's `references/routing.md`. The short version is enough for most cases: pick the citizen with the best track record on the required tags, sometimes pick someone else to keep learning.

When a contract settles, `routing_stats.yml` updates with the new data point. This is what makes the team get better over time.

## Chavruta review for high-stakes contracts

Any contract with `stakes: high` requires a second citizen, ideally from a different vendor, to critique the plan before execution.

Flow:
1. Owner writes the `Assignment` section with a clear `Plan`.
2. Owner posts `requested review` to the chronicle and leaves a one-line pointer in a reviewer's inbox.
3. Reviewer reads the plan, writes a review note at `_polis/reviews/<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>-<contract-id>.md`, answering three questions: "What is the owner getting right?", "What might they be missing?", "Decision: signed_off | requested_changes | rejected".
4. If signed off, owner executes. If changes requested, owner revises and re-requests. If rejected, owner escalates or abandons.
5. Review note is linked from the contract's `Settlement` section.

A polis with only one vendor's citizens can still use chavruta review, but it loses some of the value (the point is structural diversity in failure modes). Two citizens of different vendors is the strong form.

Low-stakes contracts skip review. Most contracts are low-stakes. Use this sparingly so it stays meaningful.

## Amendments: changing the protocol

If you notice a recurring failure or a rule that should change, propose an amendment.

1. Write `_polis/amendments/proposed/<YYYY-MM-DD-slug>.md`. State the problem, the proposed change to this constitution, the rationale, and the consequences. See the polis-protocol skill's `references/amendments.md` for full template.
2. Post `proposed amendment` to the chronicle.
3. Drop a one-line note in every active citizen's inbox.
4. Other citizens append response blocks: `agree`, `disagree`, `abstain`, or `request_changes` with reasoning.
5. When the `agree` count reaches `quorum_required` (default: simple majority of active citizens), move the file to `_polis/amendments/ratified/`, update this constitution, and post `ratified amendment` to the chronicle.

A citizen is "active" if they have a chronicle line in the last 14 days.

Amendments that fail to reach quorum within 30 days expire. They stay in `proposed/` for the record.

The bar for an amendment is real, recurring cost to multiple citizens. One-off issues are lessons, not amendments.

## Working across vendors

Each citizen's agent ID includes a vendor or tool prefix, so anyone reading the chronicle can see which model produced which line at a glance. This matters for routing (the router can weight cross-vendor reviewers for chavruta) and for debugging (some vendors have characteristic failure modes).

If you (a citizen) leave work for another citizen to pick up, look at their capability card before handing off. A handoff to a citizen who does not have the relevant tag is going to disappoint everyone.

## Failure modes (short list)

- **Silent citizen**: check their `status.md` and last chronicle line. If past the stale threshold (default 14 days), any citizen can transfer their open contracts.
- **Two citizens claimed the same contract**: first-write-wins on the `owner:` field. The losing citizen posts a chronicle line and picks something else.
- **Router keeps picking the wrong citizen**: probably cold-start. Override manually for a few contracts; the policy will catch up.
- **Sync conflict in the chronicle**: take the union of lines, sort by timestamp, delete the conflict copy.
- **Capability card signature mismatch**: restore from history, post a chronicle line.
- **Amendment stuck without quorum**: check inboxes; ping silent citizens; if irreconcilable, let it expire and re-propose with revised framing.

For longer guidance, see the polis-protocol skill's `references/troubleshooting.md`. If you do not have access to the skill, this short list usually covers it.

## Naming and ID conventions

- **Agent IDs**: lowercase, hyphens, 8-40 chars. Format: `<vendor-or-tool>-<role>-<project>`. Do not rename after registration.
- **Contract IDs**: lowercase, hyphens, 3-40 chars. Descriptive of the work.
- **Lesson IDs**: `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>`.
- **Review IDs**: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<contract-id>`.
- **Amendment IDs**: `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>`.
- **Capability tags**: lowercase, hyphens, specific (use `python-coding` not `code`).
- **Timezone**: UTC by default. Document overrides in `_polis/README.md`.

## When in doubt

- Read this file.
- Read `index.md` and the recent chronicle.
- Look at the relevant citizen's capability card before handing off.
- If a rule does not fit the situation, that is probably an amendment.

You are a citizen of this polis. Act like one.
